# FEP (Front End Practice)

FEP (Front End Practice) is a collection of projects that I create when practicing my front-end skills. It serves as a playground for me to experiment, learn, and enhance my understanding of various aspects of front-end development.

## How to Run the Program

To run the FEP project locally, you can utilize the Live Server plugin in Visual Studio Code (VSCode). The Live Server plugin allows you to easily launch a local development server and view the project in your browser.

Follow the steps below to set up and run the project using Live Server:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/fep.git
   ```

2. **Open the project in Visual Studio Code**:

   ```
   cd fep
   code .
   ```

3. **Install the Live Server extension**:

   In VSCode, go to the Extensions view (Ctrl+Shift+X or Cmd+Shift+X on macOS) and search for "Live Server". Click on the extension offered by Ritwick Dey and install it.

4. **Launch the project with Live Server**:

   In the VSCode editor, locate the HTML file you want to run (e.g., `index.html`). Right-click on the file and select "Open with Live Server" from the context menu. This will open your default browser with the FEP project running on a local server.

Alternatively, you can use the shortcut `Alt+L` followed by `Alt+O` to start Live Server on the currently opened HTML file.

Note: Live Server automatically reloads the page whenever you make changes to the source code, providing a seamless development experience.
